I built this project for fun in 3 hours to finally practice my Lebanese Arabic between lessons! Transform your Lebanese Arabic lesson notes from Notion into comprehensive flashcards using AI, automatically added to your Noji spaced repetition app.

## Features

- 📝 **Notion Integration**: Fetch and process lesson notes from any Notion page
- 🤖 **AI-Powered Card Generation**: Create comprehensive flashcards with GPT-4o-mini
- 📚 **Noji Integration**: Automatically add cards to your Noji deck with HTML formatting
- 🔄 **Smart State Management**: Resume processing from where you left off
- 🎯 **Lebanese Arabic Focus**: Specialized prompts for Lebanese dialect with cultural context
- 🔧 **Comprehensive Coverage**: Generates multiple overlapping cards to ensure complete lesson coverage
- 📊 **Progress Tracking**: Detailed logging and processing statistics

## Prerequisites

1. **Node.js** (v16 or higher)
2. **OpenAI API Key** with access to GPT-4o-mini
3. **Noji Account** with API bearer token and deck ID
4. **Notion Integration** with access to your lesson notes

## Installation

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd lebanaseanki
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install

```

## How It Works

1. **🔧 Configuration Validation**: Validates all required environment variables
2. **📋 Noji Connection Test**: Tests API connection and deck access
3. **📝 Fetch Lessons**: Retrieves all lesson blocks from your Notion page
4. **🔍 Filter Processed**: Skips already processed lessons using state management
5. **📖 Process Each Lesson**:
   - Convert Notion blocks to markdown (including images)
   - Generate comprehensive flashcards with AI
   - Add cards to Noji with HTML formatting
   - Update processing state
6. **📊 Progress Tracking**: Shows detailed statistics and completion status
7. **🎯 Resume Capability**: Run again to process only new lessons

### Card Generation Strategy

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Creates as many cards as needed to cover all content
- **Multiple Perspectives**: Generates overlapping cards (Arabic→English, English→Arabic)
- **Smart Gap Filling**: Adds missing elements in sequences (e.g., missing numbers in a series)
- **HTML Formatting**: Rich formatting with headings, lists, bold, italic, underline
- **Reverse Cards**: Automatic bidirectional learning for vocabulary
- **Lebanese Focus**: Specialized for Lebanese Arabic dialect and culture

## Card Types Generated

- **Vocabulary Cards**: Lebanese Arabic ↔ English with usage examples and context
- **Grammar Cards**: Rules, patterns, and examples with clear explanations
- **Cultural Context**: Important cultural concepts and their significance
- **Pronunciation Cards**: Pronunciation guides and phonetic hints
- **Reverse Cards**: Bidirectional learning for vocabulary (Arabic→English AND English→Arabic)

### HTML Formatting Support

Cards support rich formatting for better learning:

- **Headings**: `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`
- **Text formatting**: `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<u>`, `<s>`
- **Lists**: `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`
- **Other**: `<p>`, `<br>`

### Example Cards

```json
{
  "front": "<h3>كيفك؟</h3><p>Keefak?</p>",
  "back": "<p><strong>How are you?</strong> (masculine)</p><p>Used when greeting a male. For females, use <em>Keefik?</em></p>",
  "reverse": true
}
```
